    <pre>
    Docker is defined as an open source project that provides a system-level virtualization and abstraction layer
    operational, through the installation of software containers.
    Surely you will have stayed as you were. Relax, it's normal. The best way to explain what Docker is and what it is useful for
    is to illustrate it with a situation that, surely, has happened to you a few times. Let's see if it sounds like you.
    Imagine that you want to install a new technology on your computer / server, for example, a new self-hosted Web application
    that you just discovered and want to try, or a service like an MQQT broker that you want to install on your server.
    </pre>    

    <pre>
    When you have to install multiple technologies on the same computer. One database sticks with the other, 
    this service with that one, and the web server with the other one. As we have more things installed on the 
    same machine, everything starts to get more and more complicated. 
    </pre>

    <pre>
    But it could still get worse! When you want to uninstall something you have to play not to pass the thin 
    red line of, or remove less and progressively fill our computer with garbage, or remove more and make things 
    that you did not want stop working.

        <h2>DOCKER COMES TO THE RESCUE</h2>

    <pre>
    This is the situation that Docker is trying to solve. Docker works with images and containers. In short, 
    an image is a package that includes "everything that a certain technology needs" to function.
    Images are initialized in one or more instances that are called containers. In this way you only have to 
    create the container and a function. Of course, we can even have several containers of the same image running simultaneously.
    Many developers offer their applications as a container. Some of them are on https://hub.docker.com/, 
    the Docker repository. On other occasions, developers host their dockers on their own website, or on github, among others.
